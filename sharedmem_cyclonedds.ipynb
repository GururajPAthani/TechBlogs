    "## 🛠️ Implementing CycloneDDS with Iceoryx (Shared Memory)\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing **Eclipse CycloneDDS** with **Iceoryx** for shared memory communication involves three main components: building the libraries, configuring both middlewares, and running the applications with the necessary environment settings. This approach enables **zero-copy** data transfer for high-performance intra-process and inter-process communication on the same machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1\\. Prerequisites and Building\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to build both Iceoryx and a specific branch of CycloneDDS that includes Iceoryx support. The following are typical build steps (assuming you are building in your home directory, `~/`):\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Install prerequisites** (e.g., `cmake`, `libacl1-dev`, `libncurses5-dev`, `pkg-config`, `maven`).\n",
    "2.  **Build and Install Iceoryx (RouDi):**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx.git -b release_2.0\n",
    "    cd iceoryx\n",
    "    cmake -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install -DROUDI_ENVIRONMENT=on -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -Hiceoryx_meta\n",
    "    cmake --build build --config Release --target install\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3.  **Build and Install CycloneDDS with Iceoryx support:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds.git\n",
    "    cd cyclonedds\n",
    "    # Check out a branch that supports iceoryx if master is not the correct one,\n",
    "    # or use -DENABLE_ICEORYX=On if available in your version.\n",
    "    cmake -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install -DENABLE_ICEORYX=On -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=On -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=~/iceoryx/install/\n",
    "    cmake --build build --config Release --target install\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2\\. Configuration Files\n",
    "\n",
    "You need separate configuration files for both Iceoryx and CycloneDDS.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📝 Iceoryx Configuration (`iox_config.toml`)\n",
    "\n",
    "This file defines the shared memory pool segments. The `size` should be 64 bytes larger than your largest message type (due to header information), and `count` is the number of blocks available. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```toml\n",
    "[general]\n",
    "version = 1\n",
    "[[segment]]\n",
    "    [[segment.mempool]]\n",
    "    # Example: block size for a 16384 byte message (16384 + 64 bytes)\n",
    "    size = 16448\n",
    "    count = 32768\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📝 CycloneDDS Configuration (`cyclonedds.xml`)\n",
    "\n",
    "This file explicitly enables the shared memory exchange layer via Iceoryx.\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n",
    "<CycloneDDS xmlns=\"https://cdds.io/config\">\n",
    "    <Domain id=\"any\">\n",
    "        <SharedMemory>\n",
    "            <Enable>true</Enable>\n",
    "            <LogLevel>info</LogLevel>\n",
    "        </SharedMemory>\n",
    "    </Domain>\n",
    "</CycloneDDS>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3\\. Execution Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To run your CycloneDDS applications with shared memory, you need three separate terminal sessions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Start RouDi (Routing and Discovery Daemon)\n",
    "\n",
    "Iceoryx requires its daemon to manage shared memory segments and facilitate discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# In Terminal 1\n",
    "~/iceoryx/build/iox-roudi -c iox_config.toml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Run Publisher and Subscriber\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remaining terminals, run your DDS applications (e.g., the built-in `ShmThroughputPublisher` and `ShmThroughputSubscriber` examples) after setting the required environment variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# In Terminal 2 (Publisher)\n",
    "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/iceoryx/install/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n",
    "export CYCLONEDDS_URI=file://cyclonedds.xml\n",
    "~/cyclonedds/build/bin/ShmThroughputPublisher 16384 0 1 10 \"Throughput example\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# In Terminal 3 (Subscriber)\n",
    "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/iceoryx/install/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n",
    "export CYCLONEDDS_URI=file://cyclonedds.xml\n",
    "~/cyclonedds/build/bin/ShmThroughputSubscriber 10 0 \"Throughput example\" 16384\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Considerations for Zero-Copy:**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">   * The DDS data type should be **fixed-size** (no strings, sequences, or other dynamic containers) to enable true zero-copy.\n",
    ">   * For maximum performance, use the **Loan Mechanism** in your DDS application code.\n",
    "\n",

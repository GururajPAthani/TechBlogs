    "# RISC-V: The Open-Source Revolution Reshaping Computing from Embedded Edge to AI\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "RISC-V represents a fundamental shift in computing architecture that's democratizing hardware design. This open-source instruction set architecture is challenging decades of proprietary dominance from x86 and Arm, enabling unprecedented customization and innovation across industries from autonomous vehicles to artificial intelligence. With major adopters like NVIDIA, Mobileye, and Google leading the charge, RISC-V is projected to power over 16 billion System on Chips (SoCs) by 2030.\n",
